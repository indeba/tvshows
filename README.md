# How does the best science fiction series of the year work?

## How the main rule of science fiction helps series "People".

In the U.S. and Britain for several weeks there is a series "People" about the near future, in which people coexist with the androids working for them. There have not been good science fiction shows on TV for a long time, so "People" is a rare good luck.

Science fiction on modern television is in a strange state. It is quite a lot (although most serials are on Syfy), but not good. This season, several new science fiction series were launched at once: for example, "Killjoyce" about space bounty hunters or "Dark Matter" about an ark ship whose crew suffers from amnesia. But they are all overloaded with details and heroes, confusing and loud, while fantasy works best with minimalism. Except for 'Doctor Who', which is still a mansion, and 'Black Mirror', which is arranged as an anthology, the last good science fiction series was 'Star Cruiser Galaxy', released in the mid-2000s.

Hope appeared with the new British-American series "People". It is based on the Swedish series "Real People" and is a joint project of AMC and Channel 4. It is a series about the future, in which people created androids (here they are called synths), and they are served. At the center of the event is an English family, which gets a girl synth to help around the house. The series has already become a big hit for Channel 4 - the biggest in 20 years - and it was well received in America.

Many people notice that in "People" there is nothing revolutionary for science fiction, it is a classic story about robots. However, even the traditional ideas are brilliantly executed here - and this is a good example of how to make a science fiction series on modern TV.

"People" follow the old rule of fiction: one convention per work. It is believed that the viewer or reader of a science fiction work is ready to believe in one big conditionality that distinguishes it from our world, and around it you need to build the rest. For example: only time travel, or only aliens, or only robots. Despite the fact that many authors successfully break this rule and make good novels, movies and soap operas (for example, the writer Peter Hamilton, who manages to use in his books all of the above), this rule has logic. Such asceticism in fantastic series has not been long ago. "People" add just one detail to our reality - androids, and build all the conflicts around them. In the series everything is done with British minimalism and restraint, and one conventionality allows the authors to explore a variety of topics.
